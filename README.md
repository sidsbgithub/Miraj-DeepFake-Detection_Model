# Miraj DeepFake Detection (ResNext and LSTM)

Welcome to the Miraj deepfake detection repository! Our goal is to combat the proliferation of synthetic media by leveraging state-of-the-art deep learning techniques. DeepFake technology presents formidable challenges to media authenticity, and our system is designed to reliably detect manipulated content.

## Features

- **Deep Learning Models**: We employ advanced deep learning models, including ResNext and LSTM, trained on extensive datasets to distinguish between genuine and manipulated media.

- **Multi-modal Analysis**: Our system conducts comprehensive analysis across various modalities, including image, video, and audio, to ensure thorough assessment of media authenticity.

- **Real-time Detection**: Capable of real-time detection, our system promptly identifies and flags potentially fraudulent content as it emerges.

- **Scalability**: Designed with scalability in mind, our system can handle large volumes of media content across diverse platforms and applications.
